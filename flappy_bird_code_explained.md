# Flappy Bird Console Game in C++

This is a simple and fun console-based version of the classic **Flappy Bird** game, created using **C++**. The game is played in a text-based environment, where the player controls a bird that must navigate through columns of pipes without colliding with them. The bird can "jump" by pressing the spacebar and falls due to gravity when no input is provided. The goal is to keep the bird alive for as long as possible by passing through the gaps in the pipes while avoiding collisions with them.

This project is a great example of creating interactive games in a console window, using basic concepts like game loops, keyboard inputs, collision detection, and real-time rendering of text-based graphics.

### Features:
- Randomly generated pipes with varying gaps.
- Bird that can "jump" to avoid pipes.
- Score tracking, which increases as the bird successfully navigates through pipes.
- Game over screen when the bird collides with a pipe or falls to the ground.
- Basic menu to start the game, view instructions, or quit.
- Game loop that continuously updates the screen to create an interactive experience.

This game runs in the console/terminal and is designed to be simple, easy to play, and a fun way to learn about basic game development in C++.
